					<p>
						My name is Shawn Smith and I am a Full Stack Developer based in Salt Lake City, UT. I attended
						the University of Utah/DevPoint Labâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp in May 2020. I was in the brewing
						industry for six years but decided to change careers. I have a passion for creating things for
						people to enjoy, no matter the medium and software development fits perfectly into this passion.
						I began teaching myself web development in January 2020 and was immediately drawn to the
						challenge and creativity that programming offers. Brewing taught me a continous improvement
						mindset and I improve, learn, and create new things every day.
