						<p>
							My name is Shawn Smith and I am a Full Stack Developer based in Salt Lake City, UT. I
							attended the University of Utah/DevPoint Labâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp in May 2020. I was
							in the brewing industry for six years but decided to change careers. I have a passion for
							creating things for people to enjoy, no matter the medium and software development fits
							perfectly into this passion. I began teaching myself web development in January 2020 and was
							immediately drawn to the challenge and creativity that programming offers. Brewing taught me
							a continous improvement mindset and I improve, learn, and create new things every day.
