					<p>
						My name is Shawn Smith and I am a Full Stack Developer based in Salt Lake City, UT. I attended
						the University of Utah/DevPoint Labâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp in May 2020.  I have a passion for creating things for
						people to enjoy, no matter the medium, and software development fits perfectly into this passion.
						I began teaching myself web development in January 2020 and was immediately drawn to the
						challenge and creativity that programming offers. I have worked in the beer brewing industry for 7 years
						and that time has instilled a continous improvement mindset in me.  I constantly want to improve, learn,
						and create new things every day.
