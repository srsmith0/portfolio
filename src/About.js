						<p>
							My name is Shawn Smith and I am a Full Stack Developer based in Salt Lake City, UT. I
							attended the University of Utah/DevPoint Labâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp in May 2020. I was
							in the brewing industry for six years but am changing my career path. I began teaching
							myself web development in January 2020 and immediately enjoyed the challenge and creativity
							that programming offers. I have a passion for creating things for people to enjoy, no matter
							the medium. Brewing gave me a continous improvement mindset and I have been improving,
							learning, and creating new things every day.
